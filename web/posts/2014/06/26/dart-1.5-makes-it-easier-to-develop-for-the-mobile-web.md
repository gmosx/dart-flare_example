It’s important for web experiences to work great on mobile devices. The latest 
release of the Dart includes a development version of Dartium – Chrome with the 
Dart Runtime – which runs on Android devices. We’ve also updated the Dart Editor 
to support debugging mobile web apps written in Dart. You can set breakpoints 
and debug exceptions with Dart web apps running on a device with the same 
development flow that exists on your development machine. Check out the 
documentation to get started.

The Dart 1.5 release cycle was short – just four weeks – but we are excited to 
continue delivering great improvements to our platform and tools. 
You can see a summary of the updates in the release notes.

We have also released an update to the Dart Polymer package and shipped two sets 
of new Polymer elements. core_elements gives Dart developers access to all 
Polymers infrastructure components. paper_elements contains Polymer elements 
that follow the material design pattern that was announced at Google I/O 2014.

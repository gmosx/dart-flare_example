Google I/O 2014 is right around the corner. This year, we’re thrilled to have 
more presentations about using Dart than ever before at I/O.

If you’re keen to learn more about what the Dart team and Dart users have in 
store for you, be sure to either check out the online schedule or install the 
I/O app. Pick the topic “Dart” and you’ll be taken straight to the many 
Dart-related events at I/O.

If you’re attending I/O this year, please drop by and say "Hi" at the Dart 
booth. Many Dart engineers will be at I/O, answering questions and helping you 
with your apps.

For those of you not able to join us in San Francisco, be sure to tune into 
the live stream, join a local I/O extended near you, or watch the sessions 
on the Google Developers YouTube channel. If you can't wait, be sure 
to subscribe to the Google Developers YouTube channel already now for 
additional Dart videos produced just for I/O, including previews of some new 
highly requested features.
